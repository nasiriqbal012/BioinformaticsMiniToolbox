# BioinformaticsMiniToolbox
The tool ‘Bioinformatics Mini Toolbox’ is developed by using python language. It can be used to trim FASTQ sequence along with conversion to FASTA format, predict genes and calculate physiochemical properties of nucleotide and amino acid sequences. Moreover, genome biasness of nucleotide sequence, translation of nucleotide sequence into amino acid sequence in all open reading frames, pairwise and multiple alignment can be performed using this tool. To run the program, BMT tool can be downloaded and after extracting the compressed file, in “dist” folder run the “.exe” file. There is no need to run any command on command prompt or import any extra modules. Moreover, all required entities are built-in. When double click the “.exe” file, a main window will appear from where all seven functions can be performed.
